# Positronic Brain

A sophisticated language model inference engine featuring continuous generation, context management, and advanced token handling.

## Overview

The Positronic Brain is an advanced AI system that implements an efficient inference engine for large language models. It features:

- Continuous token generation with advanced sampling techniques
- Dynamic context management with attention-based pruning
- Token-level control with a KV Mirror system
- Optimized memory handling for long-running inference

## Key Components

- `ai_core.py`: The main inference loop and core functionality
- `positronic_brain/`: Package containing modular components:
  - `config.py`: Configuration settings
  - `controller.py`: Context injection and management
  - `kv_mirror.py`: Bidirectional token mapping and tracking
  - `model_io.py`: Model loading and inference operations
  - `pruning.py`: Context pruning algorithms
  - `sampler.py`: Token sampling strategies

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the main application:
```
python main.py
```
