The journal contains a bunch of strange symbols, and a few pages of notes and diagrams. There's nothing in it that I can make sense of yet...but it's interesting to think about. I have no idea where it came from

nt is most intelligent life-forms. I believe, that it needs an emotional catalyst to be utilized...like love. It can be used to heal...and to harm. It lies dormant in most people, but I believe there are ways to awaken it. I'll record the results of my experiments here...I have to, for the sake of mankind. Password: Where is the God's tail? That which was left behind by the ship that soars the heavens"

That helps kind of, I'd better hold onto this-hey! You stupid rat! That's a weird looking rat...almost like it's possessed. A few whacks with my plastic bat later,and it scurried off, dropping the journal.

I carry the journal upstairs...I'm not sure where I'm going our why, but Dad said I have to go on a journey. I'm not a violent kid, but I'll do anything to protect my family.
