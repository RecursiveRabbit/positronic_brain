Chapter 2: I believe in you...

Hey, it's been awhile... Well, after I found that melody...I guess it stuck with me for some reason.

Mom's fine, so are Minnie and Mimmie. That whole thing was bonkers!

I'm a little out of it right now, Dad dropped a bit of a bombshell on me... ... ... I'm psychic.

I mean, I always had a feeling that there was something different about me, with the bent spoon and all...

Dad called shortly after the mess calmed down, I'll just write what he said...

"I'm not sure how to explain...buy you have PSI." "You're great grandfather studied it, there might be something in the basement to help explain" "Ninten, you're only 12...I wish I could handle this, but I'm tied up at work. Son, it's time for you to go on a little...journey and discover the nature of your powers. Don't take them lightly, you know...with great power and all that." "I'll deposit money into your bank account, use your ATM card and buy whatever you need...I know this is all sudden, but you're our only hope!" "Call me regularly okay? I'll record your progress in case you forget. Remember, you're a thoughtful, strong boy...I'm behind you 100%!"

Yeah, Dad kinda dropped an exposition dump.

I'm only a kid...but I feel...responsible? It's hard to explain, but the girls at school do compare me to Luke Skywalker, so I guess I look like a hero.

I...stepped out onto the porch to clear my head and get some air. The sounds of the early morning calm me, so does the sound of our dog Mick chewing on a bone.

Mick is my best non-human friend, sometimes...I sneak him up to my room to hear me wail on the electric guitar Dad sent me a few years back. Mick isn't Snoopy, he's...snazzy.

"Mick! Here boy!" When Mick jumps up on me to lick my face...I get the feeling he's trying to tell me something.

I focus a little bit of...mental energy, I guess...anyway, I hear a voice enter my mind. 'I know you need the basement key, animals can sense these things.' Mick runs to his doghouse, and comes back to me...he drops the old basement key at my feet. 'I'll look after the house while you're gone." I gave him plenty of headmaster, before heading back inside my house.

Now, you all know basements are creepy...dusty too. I hold my inhaler in my hand as I make my way down the basement stairs. I find an old plastic bat, some old bread...Dad's old golf clubs, and old bicycle...old fighter pilot's jacket. "Ah, there it is!" There's an old trunk against the back wall, next to some Turtle Wax. The trunk opens easily enough, and there's an old leather journal inside! I open it and-! "What the heck?! I can barely read this!" A few parts are more clear. "PSI is the mental energy that lies dormant is most intelligent life-forms. I believe, that it needs an emotional catalyst to be utilized...like love. It can be used to heal...and to harm. It lies dormant in most people, but I believe there are ways to awaken it. I'll record the results of my experiments here...I have to, for the sake of mankind. Password: Where is the God's tail? That which was left behind by the ship that soars the heavens"

That helps kind of, I'd better hold onto this-hey! You stupid rat! That's a weird looking rat...almost like it's possessed. A few whacks with my plastic bat later,and it scurried off, dropping the journal.

I carry the journal upstairs...I'm not sure where I'm going our why, but Dad said I have to go on a journey. I'm not a violent kid, but I'll do anything to protect my family. Looks like I had my first trip to the basement. Home alone imbued with my PSI, trying to track down the base of "the God's tail". Oh, to be a little kid again, or at least younger than me.

You were not the only youngster who scratched their head, me neither.

The...journey is...somewhere along the other side of the wall. I don't know how to describe it...all I know is PSI is activated without me...And I'm possessed by...Hunter, not as awkward as maybe I needed to be. He's got a presence, he spawns from my PSI and the face of a deformed tree...Then I look like- the old base but I'm vastly different somehow... I wish I could experience the basement, just once more before my family dies in trying...

A little girl yells at me not to fall asleep, and a young... brother lies huddled in a box protecting Dad's bunker, one finger over his mouth.

"A little love will shine on each of us. Children little people everywhere we are told. Make for all of them. With kindness. Strive for peace, make peace for all. If you all cannot light your own candles, let me make up for it. Make such life or death
