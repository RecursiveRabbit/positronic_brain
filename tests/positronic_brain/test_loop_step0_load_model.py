"""
Test for Step 0 of the Positronic Brain loop: Model Loading
This test focuses on explicitly loading the model using Torch and saving
the state for subsequent steps.

Following Isaac's architecture, this implements the model loading step
with file-based handoffs for clear debugging and state tracking.
